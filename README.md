# Java_Coffee_Machine
Java project to address concepts of OOP, loops and conditional statements

In this project the programming of a coffee machine simulator was carried out. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it displays a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing is free, you also collect the money.
